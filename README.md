# üìù PDF-Notes
This repository contains some of my study notes, primarily focusing on mathematics, physics, and computer science.

## Physics
- [Conformal Field Theory:](conformal-field-theory.pdf)  
2024.6.25  
A collection of basic concepts in conformal field theory, including an introduction to the AdS/CFT correspondence.
- [Quantum Error Correction:](quantum-error-correction.pdf)  
2024.6.28
